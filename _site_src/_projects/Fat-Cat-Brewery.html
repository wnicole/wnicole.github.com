<p>A collaboration project done with fellow designer Sarah Cadwell. Illustration and lettering inspired by artist Paul Bommer. The concept was to make beer labels that combined our mutual interests in cats and feminine design. The resulting label series is fun, light-hearted and aimed at a generally unrecognized beer market: women.</p>
