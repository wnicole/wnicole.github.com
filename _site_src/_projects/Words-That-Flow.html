<p>An installation in the event series 'Revolution in the Landscape: Re-experience the Halprin Fountains' hosted by SEGD for Design Week Portland 2014. The event included installations in four interconnected parks, fountains and civic spaces. This event was recently recognized by the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Oregon with a Merit award in the research and communication category. Jury comments noted the innovative approach using interdisciplinary design thinking to raise awareness of the historical significance of the Portland Open Sequence where the event was hosted.</p>
<p>Lettering was done using stencils and free-hand lettering techniques in chalk paint. Words were based on an 'Oregon Waters' theme and arranged to form a river of words. At the end, chalk sticks were provided to give event visitors the opportunity to participate by adding their own water-inspired words.</p>
<p>Co-designer: Alan Hernandez-Aguilar.</p>
<p>Event Photographer: Bruce Forster.</p>
