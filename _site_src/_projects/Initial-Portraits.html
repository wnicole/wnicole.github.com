<p>The Initial Portraits project was created out of my mutual fascination of personalities in letterforms and people.</p>
<p>Letterforms themselves are arbitrary symbols, but they are given meaning by people. Additionally, the way that letters look can be an another layer of communication and expression of the intended meaning of a word. In this way letters can and do have their own personalities, much like people.</p>
<p>This interesting parallel between the personalities of people and letters made me want to explore the idea of using a person’s initials to express who that person is. But unlike a typical portrait, this type has the added challenge of not capturing the person’s outside appearance, but who they are on the inside.</p>
