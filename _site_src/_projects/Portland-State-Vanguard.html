<p>Noteworthy projects for the Vanguard include: art direction for the Fall 2014 Orientation Guide and cover story lettering and production for 'A Critical Mass of Voices.'</p>
<p>The 2014 Orientation Guide theme is based on subway signage systems and organization. Each article was assigned one or more ‘markers’ in the heading that would identify to the reader the type of information that the article communicated. This, as well as the styling was chosen to be bold and easy to digest for incoming Freshmen.</p>
