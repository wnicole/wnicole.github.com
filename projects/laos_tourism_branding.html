  <h1 class="project-title">Laos Tourism Branding</h1>
  This project was all about branding the country of Laos in order to help promote tourism to those people living in large, busy cities who would be looking for a quiet vacation. The brand was developed and collected in a brand standards book that would be given in a kit container that also included two complimentary tea boxes containing tea that was grown in Laos.
