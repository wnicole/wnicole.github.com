My name is Nicole Worthington and I am currently working towards my Bachelors of Arts in Graphic Design in my beautiful hometown of Portland, Oregon. I enjoy exploring different design styles and typography. My love of photography is what inspired me to get interested in Graphic Design to begin with, and I still enjoy taking pictures during any free time I can scrounge up when Iâ€™m not working on homework or at my internship.
